1,Damaged Product,"The product works fine. I ordered the more exprensive one after I read reviews from others on Amazon. My husband likes the presser. It does a good job pressing his pants. However, it was damaged in the box when we received it. We decided it was too much trouble to send it back. The box was torn and the presser had a chuck knocked out of it."
0,A waste of time and money,"This book is so useless that I feel compelled to write a review to warn others to stay away from this book. A good tutorial should inspire the user on what he/she can do with the product. This book leads you to believe that without talent, the only thing you can do with Illustrator is to draw circles and squares. The book is a disservice to both the reader and to Adobe Illustrator."
0,"Scattered, Out-of-Date,",The authors attempt an ambitious goal of covering many SOA topics - but their resulting text come across as scattered - vague - and lacking a coherent and practical application.Thomas Erl's books are much better written - and have a coherent approch to buliding a solid body of knowledge.For a manager / salesperson wanting a broad overview of SOA - they might be better served by reading Service Oriented Architecture For DummiesService Oriented Architecture For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))
0,Horrible Customer Service & Product,I ordered this product and did recieve then a couple months later it broke. Now Ive done everything I was told to do by by shipping back for a replacement and nothing. They wont return Emails i havent received the replacement part.
0,Is the joke on me?,"I hated this movie. It was so silly. The girl made the cult look more stupid than they already were. Come on? She was from the future??? I can't stop laughing. Maybe, I missed something. I don't think I did. When it first started, I said to myself: What am I watching this for? I thought it was stupid, stupid and then more stupid. I kept watching, trying to make sense of it, but to no avail. I didn't want to waste my $1.00 rental fee."
1,"Good Product, Easy to use",Product was easy to use to assemble.Product supported my weight (180 lb) and was easy to take down. I usually do not have time to work out and this product is great for quick pull up workout.Did notice some scuff marks around the door frame but no damage otherwise.

1,Good product!,"The other plastic garages and service stations that we have purchased in the past were made so poorly, but this one has really stood the test of time with two kids under the age of five."
1,"Hey ""A music fan from California, US ""","Nirvana only got popular after cobain killed himself? Obviously you're an idiot. Nirvana got mega-popular after ""Smells like teen spirit"" was debuted on MTV, and remained popular up until he killed himself. (at which time there was a spike in popularity, yes, but they were popular before).also some of kurt's lyrics are touching if you don't go in with such a bias.Of course I agree with you that Soundgarden sounds nothing like Nirvana, and I generally like soundgarden's music better.I also agree that Kickstand isn't a very strong song on the album, but I love Spoonman. It's one of my favorite tracks.Overall this is an excelent album, with a very intricate and original dark sound to it."
1,One fire...,"Tracy knows how to get you on your feet and dancing! This is an amazing effort from Tracy Young, a must have for everyone!"
0,"A good cable, but not a good value","What matters is using the cable with the highest capability your gear will support (HDMI, DVI, component), and using a decent quality shielded cable. But don't waste your money on ""features"" that won't affect the performance of the cable."
0,"The dreaded ""Remove the Cassette"" message makes this a non starter.","I've used this camera for 6 years. Last year I started getting intermittant ""Remove the Cassette"" messages. I wish I had captured the outstanding three recorded tapes onto my PC then. Instead I recorded another 45 minutes. Now, the error message is solid, no matter which tape I use.My experience with Canon in the past has taught me not to waste the time or the money to bother having this repaired. (I spent about $700 having my previous Canon Camcorder repaired. It worked a few weeks and died again each time.)Having gone to the web to research this bug, I'm convinced fixing this one will be an expensive and time consuming exercise in futility. (6 weeks plus turn around! and Canon won't tell how much the average repair cost is. Check the web .. $500+ )Lesson learned. I'll be shopping a different manufacturer. Sony? JVC? Never again Canon."
1,Works Great,"We make so many awesome things with this dehydrator, including beef jerky, dried bananas, strawberries, apples and we also made fruit roll-ups!"
0,Couldn't finish it,"I was on a plane trying to read this and instead picked up the airline magazine. I typically enjoy books about Irish families but this one didn't develop characters that I could become interested in. After half way through the book, I just gave up. I normally have a hard time not finishing a book but I didn't regret it. The style just wasn't for me."
0,dont buy polaroid products!!!!,i bought FDM-07157 under the cabinet LCD TV in 2006 (DEC). from CIRCUIT CITY who did nothing when the screen went black in april 07. polaroid has the worst customer service i have ever dealt with. cant return it cant fix it. total waste of money!!
0,"Monotonous, Implausible, Convoluted and Confusing","Let Me Call You Sweetheart, by Mary Higgins Clark, read by Bess Armstrong. A convoluted and seemingly implausible tale. Not MHC's best by a long shot, but may have lost a lot in the abridgement, which is pretty awful. Too many characters (and too many of them lawyers!) and the setting jumps between New York or New Jersey -- never quite sure. Finally, Bess Armstrong has a smooth, lovely voice, and excellent pronunciation. But it's kinda like listening to the voice mail lady read you a story, hard to catch the differences in characters, and somehow beautifully read and monotonous too? THE LOTTERY WINNER (read by Edith Bunker!) was a joy to listen to; and The Anastasia Syndrome was a delightfully neat collection - but take a pass on this one."
1,No baby yet.. but still hopeful,I've been using this product for 3 months. It seems to be pretty accurate with my cycle. I gave it 4 stars because they are a little pricey. You must use the monitor along with this which is very expensive too.
1,A tough life,"I liked the book because it is from a true story and the story is fantastic. However, I disliked the book because it has a pattern of Ruth and James and Ruth and James and so on. Finally, I liked the book because it shows you how tough a woman can be in facing her life."
0,Not good,I luv Johanna Lindsey books but this was not good at all.I don't think she was awake when she wrote this. I'm just sad bought
1,"Actually, It's Just the Tip of the Iceberg of Who Joe Is","This second CD of his really helped him boost his career and helped to uplift the spirit of the 1990s. Songs like ""All the Things Your Man Won't Do"", ""No One Else Comes Close"", and ""The Love Scene"" help to bring out his depth in R&B as a singer and performer. Personally, the song ""Good Girls"" describes how I felt for most of my life, including the period that the album came out, so as a whole, I give it 4 stars, and it's definitely worth the time and money spent."
1,Absolutely one of his best!,"Ignore Kavity Killer's one-star review; I don't know what his/her problem is with good ol' Lyle. If you have the slightest interest in Lyle, this disk is a great start. It's about as solid as they come, with a nice mix of upbeat and haunting tunes. Pontiac is my favorite of all of Lyle's disks, with Joshua Judges Ruth being a close second. Try it . . . you'll like it."
1,Great DVD and instant video combo,"I bought this dvd for my wife because she wanted a short, effective workout. Right at the bat, Jillian set the bar high at level 1. It's a continuous cardio, strengthen and abs workout for 20 minutes with 5 minutes of warmup and cool down. My wife saw results within a week. She gave the dvd to her mother so now she's workout on Amazon instant video that came with the dvd purchase. I know this workout works because my sister-in-law shed 10 pounds within 1.5 month and she looks great! Good luck on your workout!"
1,Ruby,It was a nice series. I have read Snelling before and enjoyed her books. Her family connection in the series worked well.
1,Babble fans - 2 Babble songs here,"Just a heads up. Two of the songs on 1000 Fires are Babble tunes. If you are a Babble fan, then you probably want to check this out...."
1,Fun,"My five year old loves his voice changer. In fact everyone in the house plays with it. I like how you can use multiple switches to make even more that 10 different effects. Fun, but if you have a headache or are bothered by noise then do not buy this! haha"
0,Did not work as advertised,"I was overall disappointed with this product, did not see the results and I used it as the label stated. Ended up having to buy another product"
1,Excellent book,"Very outstanding book, helped a ton of things that are just ""assumed"" elsewhere(datasheets, app notes and the like). While it's heavily based in math the book is presented in a very clear way where the math not at the forefront."
1,Concentrates On Tidbits Of Fact Most Of Us Want To Know,"Although it rarely advances too deeply into the lives of the two-hundred individuals featured and I did find a typo or two and the occasional miscued date, the facts presented are always interesting and significant to whom these people were and why they deserve to be remembered today. A very good, informative, light read for a wide audience. Never slow-moving, not over anyone's head, and should prove educational for nearly any reader. Nicely illustrated; well-chosen selection of a cross section of human society throughout time. Worth reading and worth owning. Also makes a good gift choice for the history buff on your shopping list."
1,Great picture!,"I originally had my Xbox 360 hooked up through component but my HDTV only has space for one component connection and I needed to hook up my cable box to it so I decided to purchase the VGA cable. I have an Olevia 232T and I think the image is clearer and brighter through the VGA cable than through component. I know some people complain about ""wash-out"" but I felt the image was much more vibrant and vivid through VGA. If you think the image is too bright, you can always turn down the brightness in the game. Great cable and great picture for the price!"
1,"Finally, a great hole punch","I have been using a terrible hole puncher at school for the past ten years. (hole guide shifting after every punch, a deluge of holes raining upon the classroom floor, fractured palms, etc.) After rejecting the new gold punch, I went on-line to find one that would work. Carl works. If you need some holes punched, I'm the guy to see. This punch smoothly and efficaciously handles 40 sheets - maybe more - with an ease that makes me teary-eyed. Buy it and eat the bill."
0,The price of the product,I was looking to order this product but after reading the reviews there was a change of mind. A 6 pack would have been OK for the price but almost $50.00 for one Garnier is ridiculous. Is this price correct????
1,A World of Earrings,"The book is beautifully illustrated with full color photos that are exceptional in quality. I think it would have been helpful to show how some of the earrings are actually worn, either on a mannequin head or a real person. One other feature I found inconvenient was the location of the descriptive text , which is clear at the back of the book, instead of under or in back of each illustration. The reader has to keep flipping back and forth between the full-sized photo in front and the text at the end. However, it still provides a good general survey of ethnic earrings from Africa, Asia and the Americas."
0,Wish I could give it 0 stars...,Save your money. It is awful and boring and a shame developers even wasted their time on it.
0,Just So So,"This book was disappointing, it only give a sample of Bible prophecy. Plus most of these studies of the are messianic. Also the author spend too much time give references to other Biblical authors - which is not needed. If you are a beginning Bible student this would be okay for you."
1,Great story in a well-worn setting;(post-apocalyptic world.),"I really enjoyed this story as I have others of Ingrid's. The story and the characters remain the meat of the book, instead of incidental 'buy me' sex scenes as so many sci-fi writers (or their publishers) seem to feel are required. There are some good twists to the well-worn setting of a post-apocalyptic world (e.g. the mutations being part of purposeful experiments as opposed to random consequences of the nuclear winter) as well as very interesting character development and story line. However, the ending seemed a little rushed (thus the four stars). Though there were obvious strings left dangling for its sequel(s), too many subplot conflicts were resolved quickly and neatly. Still a great 'read' and I plan to read the sequel!"
0,No support for Mac,"This looks like a fun game with a really reasonable price. Problem is, on my iMac running 10.6.8, the game does not start! Even worse, my requests for help, on their website as suggested, and by email, go ignored. I printed the manual as suggested... no help. I went to their forums as suggested... they were in a language I don't understand. On one help page, someone complains about this issue, and is told to use a wired mouse... no help there, as I'm using a wired mouse. It seems that the hardest puzzle one must solve is how to start the program. The price may have looked reasonable, but I feel ripped off."
0,A Box of Junk,"This set is a box of useless trash. Amazon, you shouldn't allow this sub-quality crap on your site. It is bad for business."
1,This was just what I was looking for!,"I am new to networking and wanted to learn more about security and hacking. I have been especially interested in exploring the hacking world and learning a few neat tricks. This book has made me aware of the methods a hacker uses, and has allowed me to experiment with these methods as well. I found the book to be very valuable for beginner and beyond, but i am now looking for a book that goes even more in depth...if possible.if you want to learn more about hacking and security... buy it! If you already are a pro... you will still benifit by it, but may want to seek something more."
0,Factual Errors in Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar,"I will not go into any details in this first review, but one very important oversight by the editors was the overlooking of the errors in factual information such as dates, names, etc. If a teacher were to use this book in a history class the students would be subject to a wealth of misinformation."
1,Must have,Any Crowes fan must have a copy of this!! I have both VHS and DVD!!! Kind of funny seeing the boys back in the day.
0,Toy never worked properly,"I had a hard time putting the arcade up. I was not pleased with the product, because 3 people was trying to put the game up. We called and called and Toys R us said tha we could not return it, due to fact that we didn't have a reciept. My son was very dissapointed, because that toy was at the top of his Christmas List. We have been advocate toy buyers from Toy's R us for over 20 years. And several times I have been displeased with the service and some of the product sold by the Lansing, IL store, you pay a lot of money for things and find out that the products were not what they appear to be on t.v."
1,A story about kings and knights,"The story's setting takes place in mideavltimes when king Arthur was king. The main charters are king Arthur,Guenever,Gawian,and Lanccalot.I had A report due and my teacher told me that this was A good book to reed.the story is about king Aurthur and his adventuer's with the knights of the round table. It also tells you about how it was to be A knight at the round table.I think it was A good book overall. The book was A good book because it told you about all the knights and what it took to be A knight. The best part of the story was when Gawain died.the worst part of the book was the begining because it wa relly boring.I wold only recemend the book to people whoare in to histoy and mideveltimes"
0,What kind of nonsense is this?,I am not referring to the CD but the review by Herbert S. Philbrick. This guy has heard one track on a radio program and he puts in a 3 star place holder? People make buying desicions based on these reviews. Herbert S. Philbrick needs a dose of responsibility....
0,I cannot believe this was ever released,"If you must hear Bette doing standards go see the movie For The Boys and buy the soundtrack, but this cd is just in bad taste. This is almost as bad as Barry Manilow's Sinatra tribute cd. Midler sings a dozen of clooney's biggest hits and makes them all into trendy pop tunes adding hip hip, and tyechno dance beats, and in so many ways is disrespecting the memory of a laegendary woman. I'm sure bette wishes she could take this back, but it's too late. This cd is not worth hearing once, let alone repeated listenings. This went straight into my waste basket. What a shame Midler might have hired a jazz combo and made a classy effort at tributing Clooney properly instead you have this mess of overproduced comemrcialism. I've never been so disapointed."
1,bumping funk,the title cut is still a Bumping track that will throw your head out of wack in a good way. who took the funk is a banger as well. dug the vocals and overall instrumentation on this set. Grooves are solid on here and Instant Funk is a Band that is slept on.
0,Down with the up rules!,The rules were interpreted - the initial game played. Will probably never play again. You are crossing arms with your opponent to place the drawn tile at the head of their column. It's messy and screws up response times.
0,Useless!,"It's been years since I had a hand-vac, so I spent a lot of time researching the ones available. I decided on this one after reading the reviews, it appeared to be the best candidate for what I needed. Unfortunately, it hasn't been worth the purchase AT ALL! The opening is so small, that anything larger or longer than a cheerio is impossible to pick up. The design of the internal components make it even harder to just keep the debris inside the canister! To top it all off, the device only stays charged for seven minutes according to the manual -- I haven't been able to get it to function well after just a few minutes. There's so many negatives, instead of listing them all -- take my word that this product is a total waste.I've decided to just buy another stand vacuum to keep in place of where we were storing this hand-vac & use the stand vacuum's hose. This hand-vac is a definite inconvenience instead of connivence."
1,excellent read,Loved it. The characters are evolving with each book and I am really beginning to care what happens to them.
1,needle threader,"I love these things, if only I'd stop dropping them because they are hard to find. They are the only needle threaders that work on my serger and they are thin enough to slide into the needle easily. I've collected a lot of similar items but threw them all out."
1,Like Having Your Own Chicken Coop,"It's so nice to have ""eggs"" available whenever you need them. I like to spontaneously bake things, and in the past have been bummed out to find that I've run out of eggs. These dried egg whites keep indefinitely in your pantry, so you never have to go without ""eggs"" again. They are also handy when you create your own pancake or waffle mix in bulk or gift giving. Bob's Red Mill brand is always excellent and I've never been dissappointed."
0,Buyer Beware,"Being desperate for ideas as to what to make my 13 year old son who is on a Candida Diet, I thought I had found a gold mine on discovering this book. I was disappointed, however, when I checked with my naturopath regarding the safety of vegetable glycerin, and was told that it could cause diarrhea and/or dehydration, and he suggested that I look for an alternative sweetener. I have had some success using Ms. Burton's recipes substituting stevia. But thanks for trying, Ms. Burton, for so many of us this is a recurring problem."
0,Worst dealer ever!!,"I ordered a book on March 14 for a birthday present. Today is April 16 and I still have not received the book. I have contacted the dealer twice, but the dealer did not respond to either email. I have also filed a claim because my credit card was charged for the book. If you actually want to buy something at Amazon, do not attempt to buy from Vertex. The worst dealer ever!!Zero stars!"
1,Good for value!!,Good for value!!Its been a month to using it.It works well-Goood!!but it takes time to heat up.
0,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!,"This tub was such a disappointment. First, it is VERY difficult to use with an infant. My daughter continued to slide down off of the sling because it did not support her. Second, it leaked after the second use. We tried placing a towel under the tub but the towel was completely soaked after about 5 minutes. By the third time the water was gushing out. Also, it is way too big to fit in your standard sinks. I think this is a waste of money and would not recommend this item to anyone. The only reason why I gave it one star is because it would not allow anything lower. I really do not feel that this tub deserves the one star. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!"
0,"Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard",I found this book to be a waste of time and money. The main focus of the book seemed to be how inadequate the Snubby is for self-defense and I like Snubby revolvers. The author missed or minimized most of the good reasons to carry a revolver other than that they can be lite in weight.
0,Worst playing video I've seen to date.,This review is mainly to warn all of the poor video quality I experenced with the VHS tape by the studio: 'Diamond Entertainment'. The video started out playing so dark I had to set my TV's brightness controls up all the way just to see anything. It also had poor tracing and just overall poor film quality. The DVD version is probably a better bet. I've seen the movie before on 'Mean Guns 20 Movie Pack - DVD' and there the movie looked pretty good. The Movie itself was not bad when seen with a nice quality DVD or maybe another studio's video.
0,"""Device not recognized""","Prospective buyers, beware!I did a lot of research, and finally settled on the Creative Zen Vision:M. I was certainly impressed when it arrived, it is handsome and the player itself is easy to figure out, with gorgeous sample photos and videos to admire as I installed the software.When I finally plugged the ZVM into my PC, an alert came up, ""Device malfunction, not recognized."" Since then, I've spent 12+ hours researching the internet, downloading fixes, firmware updates, driver updates, etc., to no avail. I am an average PC user, but common solutions include meddling around in the registry and completely re-installing windows XP. I haven't been brave enough to do either of those yet.I do believe the ZVM will be fantastic when I get it to communicate with my computer, it has such great reviews. I just want everyone to be aware that mine is a common problem, as demonstrated on Creative's Support website. Don't be dissappointed if it happens to you."
0,Okay.,Although the concept of this book is a great idea I just couldn't get into all that much. It got boring and monotonous quick.
0,Basic and unmoving. Unoriginal.,"With the caliber of musicians playing on this album, I expected a hard hitting original. Instead we get re-arranged covers and lots of ""filler"" salsa. No surprises here. The classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious, you'll play this one once."
0,Not pratical for learning any useful programming,"I have tried making my way through this book many times. But I cannot get past the author's incessesant penchant for the mayan calendar. I did not find any use in going through code snippets (which are very hard to read, they are screenshots in small font)that taught me how to manipulate dates (leap years, mayan calendars etc.) I found this approach extremely boring. Infusing text with an occasionally comment of marginal wit, does not make it entertaining.The only redeeming portion of this book it that it does include a good introduction to Tkinter. I just wish someone with a better understanding of instructional writing had written it.Like so many other Python books, does every introduction to subjects such as funtions, classes, objects and methods have to be about spam? I know where python got its name...but enough already!"
0,too jazzy,"Gee, this is my first negative review for Chris Rea. Why? Well I expect it is because this cd moved away from what one might associate with Chris Rea....it may be of liking to jazz enthusiasts, but it was too jazzy and mundane for my taste.""Dancing With Strangers"" is a good representation of early Chris Rea (and IMO very good) I would also recommend ""The Blue Cafe"" and ""King Of The Beach"" where you can get many good tunes that are not on his ""best of"" CD's.I am the only negative review, but I think these folks appreciate jazz a bit more than I do. I love the sax as a compliment to music and even though the sax in this cd was done well, it couldn't save this flat and somewhat drab cd."
1,NOT TOO BAD.,"GOOD FOR THE PRICE.IT IS NICE AND USEFUL ESPECIALLY THE BIG BOWL.THE SMALLER ONES ARE O.K ,IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT BIGGER."
0,Broken,"Arrived non-functional. Called Motorola who offered to exchange it but they never followed through on sending me return packaging. I ended up needing to resolve the issue through the distributor, who clearly wasn't responsible for it not working."
0,Thoroughly disappointed,"I have seen many craft magazines come and go. I hope this one goes. Granted, there is no commercial advertising in it, but paying anything over $1.98 per issue would be too much. The crafts are mainly useless, juvenile, and lack polish. I purchased my subscription sight unseen because it was through supporting a local school (the only saving grace to this whole experience), but that is a mistake I will not make again. It took at least three months after ordering it that I finally received my first issue. I opened it with great expectation of finding original and practical crafts for my home, but was immediately thoroughly disappointed. Thankfully, my subscription will be expiring soon.If you are a serious crafter, I recommend passing by this one."
0,"Terrible, unprofessional","Very disappointing video. The hostess was pleasant, but the content was useless. One of the tricks was to go fetch. How do you teach that to your dog? Throw the ball and give him a treat when he brings it back. Hello! The dogs doing the demo's couldn't even complete the tricks."
0,could have been alot better,"The funniest pairing was that of the hot young woman with the wrinkly old man. Now THAT had some mileage, but unfortunately, the story departed and you barely even saw the old man again. Classic bait and switch. Overall, kind of an odd movie. Was barely entertaining enough to watch the whole thing through, and if I had it to do over again, probably wouldn't."
0,You get what you pay for...,"Please don't buy these headphones if you are expecting to get a lot of bang for your buck. They cost very little, and therefore have very little quality. I used them for about 2 weeks and stopped. They hurt, the sound is horrible, and they fall apart quickly. If you need some quick headphones to use for a temporary amount of time, then get these. But if you need a good quality pair then trust me, it's worth it to spend the few extra bucks."
1,Great deal,love amazon diaper deal! Huggies are the best and I can afford them when I buy them on here!!!!!!!!!! They are great for lasting multiply hours. Huggies customer service is amazing as well!
0,Disappointing,"I'd been meaning to read this book for a long time, and I realize that it's considered a ""classic"", so I was surprised and disappointed when I finally got around to reading it. Basically, Holt describes various situations where children are playing and learning. If I hadn't already observed the same kinds of things with my own children, maybe this would have been enlightening. If you're someone who's spent time with young children, I don't think you'd get much out of this book. Perhaps if you haven't, then it might be interesting."
0,The box listing does not match what's on the DVDs,"This is either a case of sloppy copyediting or rushing in production. The DVDs do not contain the episodes as listed on the box, which makes finding a certain episode next to impossible. Disappointing."
1,A Classic Resource for the Serious Bible Student,"In addition to the Bible , the four basic key aids for study are a bible atlas, bible dictionary, concordance, and last but not least a good handbook. After some research, it was clear that Halley's was far and away the most revered and trusted. I found most useful the background and history of biblical people and events that which have made the scriptures come alive. I am amazed how he packed so much information in this relatively small volume. Highly Recommended."
1,The dignity of subsistance living,"This is a fascinating look at the story of a Canadian sailor, John MacLennon, who enters deeply into the life of the Chukchi people on the Chukhotka Peninsula in Siberia. John at first is shallow and is repulsed by the Chukchi way of life, but in time marries a native woman and has children with her. He is reborn as a real human being, one who can see the Chukchi as admirable and dignified human beings living in a harsh environment that still provides them with what they need and love.The writing is somewhat flat, but the overall effect is mesmerizing. Read this book if you're interested in native ways seen from the inside. The author is himself a Chukchi and an important political leader as well. The sense of place is overwhelming and the characters are fully drawn."
0,faulty design,"these glasses seemed fine at first and I actually liked them a lot, but after 3 months they have developed some strange layer on the inside surface of the lens. Amazon return period is over. They say they have a life time warranty, but the manufacturer wants to charge me as much as the glasses cost to send me a replacement pair."
0,If I could rate her Less than 1 Star I Would,"Her currently single ""Say How I Feel"" is absolutely nothing like her album.Her album is garbage in my opinion. She doesn't sing to the melody in the music, it's almost like she could have sang the lyrics to some songs to the tune of Old McDonald and it would have sounded the same.An absolute waste of money. This CD is the reason why people download music before they buy. I wish i would have done the same.Don't believe the 4 or 5 star rating. Totally inaccurate."
0,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!,"I have payed an additional $4 in order to get a 24 hours delivery, and it has been more than 26 hours and it still didn't show upTHAT IS THE LAST TIME I'M GOING TO BUY ON AMAZONCREDIBILITY IS CRITICAL"
1,Makes mornings faster!,"This is great for making smoothies in the a.m. I haven't had any problems with it - I use frozen fruit and juice and it works great. The cup is HUGE - I wish it were a bit smaller, say 12 oz. I use this almost every morning and have used it for about 2 mos. and it works fine."
1,"A Good, Solid Recorder","This is my second DVD recorder (the first was a Cyberhome).Many people complain about the Icon system and settings layout on this unit for being hard to understand and confusing. This is true to a point, however, after using it a few times it comes easy (it isnt THAT bad). Do keep in mind however, that DVD recorders are a bit more complex than a VCR. There are many more setting adjustments that you can make. This alone makes ANY DVD recorder a bit harder (at first) to understand ""right out of the box"". As far as quality recordings, this unit does a great job, even at lower speeds, from cable or from a vcr. The Firewire input is a nice touch if you have a digital camcorder."
1,100% INSANITY,"This is quite possibly the most insane game you will ever play on any game console. Use your buckets to catch the bombs. Simple, you say? You won't be saying that when the Mad Bomber starts dropping those bombs at an ever increasing rate (not just in numbers, but also in speed). You have to have excellent reflexes if you want to score big."
0,Really terrible product,"Well, i was so excited when i got the package. inserted the installation disk and i was prompted that installation was blocked due to compatibilty issues. I am running windows 7 ultimate and a microsoft product is incompatible with it. NO SOLUTION AVAILABLE CURRENTLY. What do I do? I am so very upset. Beware of this product."
1,A great game,"This game rules. It's a lot of fun. I'm so bad at it I can't even beat the game on easy and i still love it. Skirmishs are awesome. There are so many different strategies to use, you'll probaly never figure out all of them. And the expansion packs make it even better(I suggest aftermath, which you can get with the regular game in the arsenal package, But I hear counterstrike is decent also.) I also haer that it is cool to play on the internet, but i've never got that mode to work. The only domnside is you can't play skirmishs. But at this point, I wouldent buy. You will probaly start to play, Love it, Play it alot, Get the new one in october, and throw out the old one. This is a great game, But i suggest you wait for the new one."
1,: ),"great story! the characters had great, rich personalities. the only problem with this book was the way it was told. ""but dear reader."" just get on with the story already! other than that, it was a great story that's too good to forget."
1,Compressorless Nailing,"Great product for people that don't want to haul a compressor around in order to use a nailer. Make sure you have a good electrical connection though, the lights dim when you fire the nailer."
1,The Best Book I Ever Read,"I saw that the average rating for this book was 4 and a half stars and I had to write a review. This is the best trilogly I have ever read. The plot and story are wonderfully complex. Phillip Pullman is a wonderful author and has written this trilogy magnificantly. I must say that the beginnings are a little slow and dull but hang in there, it's worth it. It also might seem a bit confusing for some but it all comes together. I absolutly love this trilogy. It is hard to put in words my joy when reading it. I would recommend this book to anyone, young or old, which I have. The story only gets better and better with each book. I am just in awe to how Phillip Pullman thought up and wrote this intricate tale. It is filled with so many wonderful surprises and twists it is impossible not to love. Take my advice and read this trilogy, you definitely won't regret it."
1,A Civilians Opinion,The book kept me intrigued from beginning to end. I don't think I would have found this book on any book shelf let alone read it without me being asked to read the book. The book opened my eyes to the Iraq War. From the beginning to the end the journal entries kept me turning the pages. Read the book find out about the daily life of a army journalist/solider.
1,Necessity,It helps to use the system for people that do not play games on the PS3 because all the buttons are like a standard blue-ray/dvd player. Easy to link up (1 minute) and batteries last a long time.
1,Principles of Database Systems,This book does a wonderful job explaining database systems using Java. I have read many books on the subject and this is the best one I have found.
0,Not a standout in any way,"The characters go through their motions but it just doesn't meet the standards established by other police dramas. For stories and acting that will keep you looking at the screen rather than at your watch, try The Shield, Law and Order, Foyle's War and A Touch of Frost."
0,Such a fun DVD but ours was loaded with skips,"Too bad the quality of this DVD was so bad. It was loaded with skippps. We are exchanging it, hope the new one is better. Otherwise, what a terrific fun DVD for a dancing girl."
0,Better than Hatebreed?!,"Whoever said this band is better than Hatebreed is way off. These herbs don't even come close. Don't waste your money. Jersey has the worst ""hardcore"" bands ever."
0,its ok,nothing special i would recommend spending more money on the other desk mats this thing is kind of weak looking
1,Better Safe Than Sorry,"I've used several carbon monoxide alarms from First Alert for the past couple of years. Sadly, I was very dissapointed with the fact that they've shorted out after only a few months. For Kidde, they've made high quality carbon monoxide alarms, but also a very convient prices. The Kidde KN-COBB Basic Carbin Monoxide Alarm is a very simple and easy to setup alarm. This alrm is very affordable, and you can easily hang it up, without any problems. It is also easy to install the batteries, unlike those that require a 9 Volt batteries. Here, all it takes is a trio of AA batteries, and it works better, even during a power outage. Kidde does show it, and I really suggest you have one for your everyday houselhold.Price: B 1/2+Setup: B+Convience: BOverall: B"
1,Excellent,"Well done, feel good, and extremely realistic. Sami potrayed the character well. Another great french film."
0,Not Like New,"I ordered a paperback copy of this book which was supposed to be ""like new"". The book I received was a hardcover copy not to mention that the book was pulling away from its binding."
1,Go-to breakfast food,"I eat oat bran cereal almost every morning for breakfast. This was a great deal, and a convenient way to purchase it."
1,season 6 lost,"we are addicted to LOST...silly as it is. we were getting the discs on netflix, but season 6 was not out yet. after purchasing a roku box, which came with a $certificate for amazon VOD....i was able to purchase season 6 for a great price. ahhhh, no waiting for netflix to acquire rights. LOST is very well done for a tv show.....but it is an addiction."
1,A hilarious how-to,"What a gloriously funny book! Even the recipies were funny, and well, how funny did you think a recipie could be?! I ""discovered"" this book en route to Jamaica back in May--the stranger next to me read it all the way there. Well, the cover just grabbed me and I HAD to have it. It was a quick, light read that had a very wise and uplifting last chapter. Oh, and for those who are clueless like me in the beginning, this is not a fiction novel, but a wacky manual about life, love and other good stuff that we should all follow to the hilt!"
0,Harman Kardon managed to produce a flop,"If you want Harman Kardon receivers it's ok. Even most of the DVD's. I own a 22 and a 31 and I also got this one which is really annoying.Issues:- it does not save caption settings- it does not save video settings; even after I set it up to be 16:9 1080i default it always reverted to 720p.- after a period of time the DVD unit itself refused to read discsI returned to HK, got a replacement and I'm testing it to see if there are any improvements, but... I think this is unacceptable for HK. After all I did not buy an 80$ Sony, and if I bought HK I bought it for the name which supposedley means quality."
0,Memory Card Error,"Same problems as everybody else. 14 months after purchase it ate the card. Tried 2 different cards, no dice for either. From love to hate. Dang. Also Canon's support website/acknowledgement of this problem is non-existent. It was hard enough to navigate their site, but it's impossible to find anything relevant."
0,The lenses scratch easily,I can be tough on safety glasses so it may be no fault of the mfg but IMO the lenses scuffed and scratched rather quickly.
1,Awesome knife for the price!,"Love the quick drawing action, works beautifully! Great knife at a great price. Get you one son!"
