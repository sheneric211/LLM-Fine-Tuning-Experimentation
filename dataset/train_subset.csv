0,Anyone who likes this better than the Pekinpah is a moron.,"All the pretty people in this film. Even the Rudy character played by Michael Madsen. This is adapted from a Jim Thompson novel for cryin' out loud! These are supposed to be marginal characters, not fashion models. Though McQueen and McGraw were attractive (but check out McQueen's crummy prison haircut) they were believable in the role. Baldwin and Bassinger seem like movie stars trying to act like hard cases. Action wise, the robbery scene in the Pekinpah version was about 100 times more exciting and suspenseful than anything in this re-make."
0,Author seems mentally unstable,"I know that Tom Robbins has a loyal following and I started the book with high expectations. However, I did not enjoy this book as it was too much work to follow his confused logic. I think that he was under the influence during most of time that he wrote."
1,Spaetzle Noodles,This type of spaetzle maker is easier to manuveur than the old press kind and much easier on the hands. The difference is that this new spaetzle maker makes smaller noodles than the old. It is great for us elderly that don't have much strength left.
1,Cool product until the cats lost it . . . .,"My cats seemed to be amused to work for their food. One cat would roll the ball with her paws and nose, and the other would walk behind her and eat up whatever fell out -- teamwork! I knew they'd dig this ball because I had already made something similar out of a plastic water bottle before that they liked a lot.A few weeks after getting this, though, the ball was never to be found again. I think it may have rolled down into the dark basement at some point and became one with the clutter.+1 for the adjustable hole sizes. -1 for the mess that happens when trying to put the food in by hand (although this could be solved with a funnel)."
1,Works as expected,"I've had no problems running this with my Dell 8200 PC running Windows XP Home Edition which is running an addon USB 2 card, to which this hub (I have the 8 port version) is connected. When I bought it a year ago, I thought that 8 ports would be overkill and that 4 would be adequate, but I bought this unit anyway. Boy was I glad, right now 6 of the 8 are in use."
1,Not a bad deal...,"If you're considering purchasing this movie, I have to figure you're either a huge fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar, or you've seen the movie in the past and really liked it. Either that, or you're like me and you bought it as a gift for someone else, lol (although I did see this in the theater years ago and liked it). So there's not much use in reviewing the movie itself.As for the DVD release...you're not going to get anything in the way of extras (correct me if I'm wrong, but I think there's only a trailer)...but you do get the movie in both widescreen as well as pan and scan. It's of good quality, and it came at a good price (at least it did when I purchased it, lol)."
1,Nice extras on the 300 DVD,"Good picture on blu-ray, but I don't know if it would be much different on DVD since the lighting in the movie is pretty dark."
0,Too Mellow for Me,"I've always been a John Mellencamp fan (all the way back to Jack and Diane). It's been a while since I've bought one of his albums, but I bought this one on a whim. I should have read some reviews first. I'm very disappointed. Cuttin' Heads and Peaceful World are ok songs, but there isn't a standout in the bunch. Too many of them are too mellow. Pass on this album if you like the older stuff."
1,just what I needed,I need t's like this to get through my days at the barn with the horses! They're great and thanks for the quick shipping.
1,nasty,"In 1880s Australia, a lawman makes a deal with a bandit to bring his murderous brother to justice. Simple story about the brutality of frontier life has direction, cinematography and characters reminiscent of the best 60s spaghetti westerns such as ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (1969). Viewers may also enjoy the similar-styled ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"" (2005) and ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007)."
1,"Yeah it's pricey, but it's pretty funny...","OK, if you aren't a die-hard Family Guy fan, if you don't like the jokes that go on for a little TOO long or the jokes that normally start with ""like that one time when Peter..."" this isn't for you...That aside, if you like all the side gags on family guy where they trail off to something that is completely off subject, this IS for you. To me, this disc is filled with the things Seth couldn't find space for in a Family Guy episode or that the FCC would have a stroke over if they did. I absolutely love Family Guy and the fact that they don't care too much about being politically correct...it's refreshing and this disc stays true to that. It's raunchy, just wrong sometimes, and pretty hilarious all at the same time.I didn't give it 5 stars because it's a little pricey for only an hour's worth of fun. Enjoy!"
0,Not worth the money,"I'd give it a 0 if I could.I bought this toy last night after a customer in the store gave it great reviews. This toy is totally ridiculous. My 10 month old loves elmo. He has all of the other elmo dolls (hokey pokey, ymca, chicken dance, tickle me, rock n' roll, even the build a bear elmo) and a hand puppet and loves these. He looked at the tmx like it was having a seizure. He actually crawled away from it and didn't give it a second look. My six year old played with it for maybe a minute and then said ""Does it do anything else?"" Unfortunately, it doesn't. Maybe if it would talk or sing a song it would be better. But you can hardly understand what he is saying and it just isn't entertaining.Buy something better with your $40.00"
0,You get waht you pay for...,"I've had mine for just over 6 months, and it crapped out. My Heier lasted 6 years, and I wish I would have spent the extra money to buy one."
0,"Sensible, average, but not innovative.","I'm pleased I bought this book. It provides a sensible and fairly exhaustive overview of the rise of the Nazis. But I'm also disappointed. The book contains nothing unique or original. In terms of fact and interpretation it is safe and conforming, and devoid of originality.Perhaps my standards are unrealistic, or maybe my expectation of a book by Professor Evans, a distinguished academic at Cambridge University, was too high. Either way I don't rate this book as a lofty contribution. It lacks the penetrating analytical touch of Michael Burleigh's similar but better work, and as the first work of a trilogy does not inspire me to think about buying the next two volumes."
1,A great comfortable pump.,"This is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you're looking for a slightly wider toe box. It looks great with a skirt or slacks. My only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable, and kindest to my feet, I can't find my size (6.5 W) in navy. I have the shoe in black. If anyone from Naturalizer is reading this message; how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available?"
0,way overated,this band is one long joke.aside from three songs this is spinal taps warm up band.i can't believe all the love they get.
0,Player is flawed and Digitalway does not support,"I was given the FL100 as a gift and soon realized the product is flawed. If the player is connected to the PC and the battery dies, it will corrupt the internal memory and the player will not restart after replacing the battery. The player BIOS will initiate, however, once the internal memory check is complete the message ""Battery Low !!!"" will appear and it shuts down. The internal memory can be re-formatted but the player must be on to do so. I contacted Digitalway regarding this and they said, ""If the player purchase date is less than 30 days old and you have the receipt, you may return it to the place of purchase. If the player purchase date is more than 30 days and less than 120 days old and you have the receipt, you may return it to Digitalway."" The key here is receipt. I also believe they are not really backing this product. I would recommend looking at comparable players and especially the warranty."
0,Religious Tone,"I did not think that this book added a great deal of real information that wasn't just common sense. Also, parts of it reminded me of a religious sermon. This seemed to be out of place and totally unexpected. The book was not what I expected. This book is great for the religious right, not the general public."
0,As Muddy As the Whangpu,"Alas, despite the enticing title and initially engaging, gossipy style, this book bogs down in repetitive trivial details while failing to explore fasciniting topics to which it alludes (such as the international drug trade in the early 20th century and its links to Shanghai and to international arms trading after WWI). Little effort is made to identify individuals as they reappear in subsequent chapters or to present a coherent historical narrative. This is one of the very few books I have ever simply chosen to put down rather than finish."
1,The Outsiders,"The book called The Outsiders was written by a 16 year old girl named S.E. Hinton. It takes place in Oklahoma. The main Greasers are Ponyboy, Dally, Sodapop,Darry, Johnnyboy,and the least ones are Two-bit and Steve. Ponyboy,Darry,and Sodapop are all brothers. They lost there parents in a car accident.Ponyboy,the youngest, and Johnnyboy , who is 16,get in some trouble with the Socs. The Socs are Cherry, Bob, Randy and Marcia. In the book one of the guys dies... but you have the read the book on your own.The lesson in the book, I thought, was that everyone has a rough life. All age groups do and also their classes. This book would be good for ages 11-16. I think this because thats when it starts to get hard for the kids.I like the book over all. The book was kinda slow at first. I liked the book beacause what you learn from it. It has a lot of emotion. I would recomend this book to anyone."
1,Global Groove Mask,"This CD has a great pulsating driving rhythm. The different musical sensations can bring the emotional force to its explosive peek, it isnt your regular ""bump and grind."" Put this one in your CD player and get into the Global Groove. Loved it. THIS ONE IS A MUST ! ! ! ! Take the mask off and let the rhythm move you........."
1,Great book but lesser in the series,"All of the Shopaholic books are great but this one was not as good as the others. Don't get me wrong it is still worth reading and leaves the impression that there is more to come but it simply does not compare to the first three books.Becky is even more out of control than ever in this installment of the series, when she meets her long lost half sister, who happens to HATE shopping. Becky with her overwhelming desire to be the best sister ever (because she was always an only child) tries so hard to get her new sister (who happens to be everything Becky is not) to be her best friend. The usual hilarity that comes with Becky insues and Kinsella once again provides her reader with great fun and laughs.Ending gives the impression that there is more of Becky's life to come... can't wait for another book in this great series."
0,Bad re-edit of a fun film,For some reason when it was released in the US this year they decided to edit out most of the comedic scenes and most anything not directly involving Jackie Chan from the earlier release. They also almost totally replaced the soundtrack with music that for the most part didn't match the scene. I like Jackie Chan films but this release was very disapointing. The only up side was that the voices were re-dubbed by I think by the original actors. The action is still good but the older versions of the film are better.
1,A greate book for beginners,"This book has a lot of general information about Tanganyikan cichlids and the way to keep them in a home aquarium. The pictures in the book have a special glossy cover, which makes them look very good. It's an excellent 'first book', but someone interested in information about specific cichlid should search for them in another book."
1,Sennheiser Headphones,The unit works well and has a nice long cord and was a good value. The ear pads are a bit small.
0,Worst DVD Player I have ever owned!,"This DVD Player looked good online and the reviews at the time were not that bad so I purchased it; however, I can tell you that this is the worst item I have purchased online! This system does not allow you to fast forward/rewind; it only lets you jump from scene to scene. It was manufactured very cheaply; its remote control is a joke. I am so disappointed!"
1,Marching to the beat of a different drum,"I posted the book's table of contents - see ""Customer images"" link above - and would like to point out Chapter 4, which discusses ""relational data mining"", also recommending the closely related Chapters 3 and 7. (But not Chapter 2; the authors' mastery of time-series methods - if these do belong to data mining - is not obvious).I am skeptical about applicability of the proposed method, and would consult other books on neural nets or fuzzy logic - or Bayesian belief networks, for example, forgotten here - but others may disagree.Jeers to Kluwer for charging over $100 for a book that really should cost $50-60, yet not hiring a proof-reader. (""Daiwa Secretes""!)"
0,not what I was hoping for,I had sampled this at a store once and absolutely loved it. But the bottle I have smells acidic and chemically and the sent hardly last. Wish I had returned it. :(Too bad I normally love their stuff. The seller was prompt and cool and all that.
1,Absolutely Horrifying,"I first read this book at age 10 and could hardly sleep for 3 days. I have re-read it many times since, and I am glad to report that it is still as frightening to the adult as it was for the child. This book teems with terrifying images and situations which I won't describe so as not to spoil the suspense. This was what scared me as a child. What scares the adult on top of this is the emotional collapse of Jack Torrance and his descent into madness. The relationships in the family triad are brilliantly depicted. This is a novel about the horrors of alcoholism, insanity, and child abuse, which are of course only compounded by the supernatural evil these characters become enmeshed in. This is my favorite King novel and I would really like to know what happened to Danny Torrance when he reached adulthood!"
1,Great Movie,"A must see, great story and great ending, watch this movie!!!! Perfect for a slow Sunday afternoon or a could day when you are snowed in."
1,Great Value,This book was very heart touching and blew every thing I thought I knew about the Holocaust out the water. Great read for mature audience.
0,"This Cd, has absolutely zero point on this earth....","If you are a real house style raver, I suggest you consider buying another CD. I was recommended this CD, and I was disappointed when I heard it....The beats are not innovative at all, and rappers with the same style as Doc Ock, are a dime a dozen. Heed my warning and stay away from this cd at all costs....."
0,Not the OEM Unit that was listed!,The battery I received is not from APC as the picture and the description suggested and I was not able to return it.
1,Good LIve Curtis,"This album is pretty good. Its very energetic and the mix is good. Some excellent effects on ""if there's hell below"" This is the only Curtis live album I have and I like it alot. Some of the Keyboards sound a little lame, but dont let that stop you from enjoying this album. Excellent rythym section"
1,Eats Wood!,"I looked at all the planers. I was going to buy a planer with AMPS being my first concern. With a 3.4 amp motor this planer did not fail once. I put this machine to work on rough cut white oak with the blades full bore, and I got tired before this Hitachi planer. My only wish is the shoe as in all planers in this class was 1 inch longer. With a longer shoe or base this would get 5 stars. At this price you cannot go wrong. Blades are a snap to change, and sharpen. This is a nice machine."
1,yummy choc. milk,Gave this as a gift and she absolutely loved it. Said it was the best choc drink she ever had. Great gift item.
1,Good book - recommended for everyone who manages testing,"I very much liked the book. Rex Black has written about the process and management side of testing. This makes it an ideal complement to Cem Kaner's ""Testing Computer Software"" (which deals with testing technique) and Boris Beizer's ""Software Testing Techniques"" (which deals with the fundamentals).I found the templates useful, mostly because I never worked my way around Excel to get those metrics in an automated manner. But don't expect them to be replacement for commercial test management tools.This should be a required reading for anyone who plans or manages testing."
1,MY FAV BOOK,"This is by far my fav book. It's very Sex in the City set in the 50's. It's very stylized and true to it's era. Plus if you like reading about show business, than this book will be fascinating. It's a easy fluff read, so don't expect it to be A Tale of Two Cities or anything like that!!! It's fun, just look at the cover...It's pink!"
0,"Not impressed, but I still passed","I wanted to post this review, because I must have misunderstood the purpose of these CLEP books. As was indiciated to me today by the testing center, these books are designed to refresh the memories of people who have a good knowledge base of the subject. For individuals such as myself, who haven't taken American History since the early 90's, it didn't prepare me like I expected it to.I studied this book for three months, I had a 95% on each of the practice exams, and I barely passed this CLEP. Passing is passing, I agree, but just keep in mind that this book is a framework. There were so many questions on my exam on topics my clep book didn't touch on. Good thing I like the History channel.Anyway, good refresher, but maybe it's wise to supplement with a cheap high school/college text to be safe."
0,untitled,"I don't want to be harsh. I'm fairly certain that many people put a lot of effort into this book. I just didn't think that it was really a worth the effort though.Essentially the only chapter I found useful was chapter 5. Of course, one chapter doesn't make the book worthwhile though."
1,Beautiful singing!,"I enjoyed this group's previous CD very much, but ""Hoping It Might Be So"" is even better -- the selection of pieces is unusual and the performances are exquisite. ""The Oxen"" is my favorite at the moment, although I also love ""Quem Pastores"" by James Bassi (Why haven't I heard of this composer before? Where have I been?). The choir has a gorgeous sound, and the harp accompaniments are simply lovely. I listen to Christmas music year-round, and I think this CD is going to get a lot of play! I highly recommend ""Hoping It Might Be So"" to anyone who loves fine choral music."
0,Cheap copy,"The disk arrived in a plastic box used for CD's-- not a regular package. The installation directons, printed on the disk itself, state that auto-run will begin when the disk is inserted in the disk drive. Nothing happened and I had to use My Computer and the Setup.exe file to start the installation. About halfway thru the process, it stopped and would not restart. Our son (a computer guy) said the disk is a standard cheap copy type that we can purchase anywhere-- not the usual higher quality that Broderbund would use. Finally we got it installed on the main computer but it would not install on my laptop. I guess it's true-- you get what you pay for. This was cheap enough and that's good. If I have any more problems, I will return it to Amazon."
0,Disappointing considering all the high ratings,Gruen writes like a woman who is trying to sound like a man. Her word choice and syntax did not ring true and unfortunately the method cost her some in credibility. The book was nothing to write home about and certainly did not rank with anything by Erik Larson. The high ratings from other reviewers are puzzling. The reviews about the movie seem to more accurately reflect the quality of the book.
0,Try any other GPS software,"Currently I have over 20 hours in to trying to understand and use this program. I have paid my computer support person over $125. To date I have used the program and found that the route was there but not the map, the map and not the route. I can't find any voice for my Windows mobile device. You are never sure if you are on the right road. I'm so frustrated with this program! I really feel that I have tried to give it a fair chance."
1,Step up to this plate,"For fans of dub as well as jungle and drum & bass, dubstep is a terrific combination of these genres. And for those new to this type of music, The Roots of Dubstep provides a most fitting introduction as it features cuts by many of the better known musicians making dubstep. Personally, I find this kind of music perfect not only for dancing but also for working behind my computer as it is completely energy inducing, without being unduly distracting. So whether you have to write a paper, paint your house or just want to get down and dance, the Roots of Dubstep will give you the necessary step up."
1,Great travel pack,"This bag is nearly perfect. The straps easily tuck away, which is great when using the pack as carryon luggage for a flight or on a train. The front zips open all the way, so you can access the stuff at the bottom of the pack as easily as the stuff on top. The bag isn't huge, which is its greatest strength and weakness. I just spent two months backpacking in India and the bag still looks new."
1,The Diet Cure,This book was so encouraging. The self test to identify my levels made this read a keeper. I experimented with one amino acid for evening carb cravings and just like promised... there were immediate results. I haven't eaten at night out of hunger or comfort for 6 weeks. The biology is simple and the comparison of refined grains lending to addiction with not only food but alcohol was a game changer for me. I have a plan for a year's investment in a quality multivitamin and a list of supplements that make sense and are easily obtainable. I believe I will finally be successful in my journey to become healthy.
0,Very disappointing,"Sorry to say, this movie was a disappointment. Harrison Ford was not at his best, I expected better. He did not make a convincing cowboy. The Indians seemed to be rather lame in the movie. The characters were not well developed at the beginning of the story. A boring movie, the plot was not well done. The only decent part of the movie were the special effects, especially when some of the actors did their own stunts."
0,"As many people in the world I got ""Memory Stick Error"" (C:13:01) on my Sony DSC-W5)","Please be carefull, this is not a lie, lot's of people are having problems whit this memory.""Memory Stick Error"" (C:13:01) on my Sony DSC-W5) rises 1 month after I bought this camera, then suddenly It works again, but I'm expecting to have this problem again. My advice: do not buy it, at least until a new corrected version become available."
0,flimsy,Although there is metal in it; it is extremely flimsy and does not hold discs securely. A total waste of money!
1,This is one of the BEST books I've read.,I have ordered this book for Christmas gifts for at least 15 friends and family members.I'm an avid reader (at least 1-2 books a week) and I usually forget about the books shortly after I've read them. This book is hard to forget. Weeks later I can still recall whole chapters. It has touched my life so much and I want to share it with as many people as possible. I highly recommend this book.One year later - One of the books I gave was to a friend who died unexpectantly. We talked about this book so many times and now I know that she is in her own room of marvels. It has helped me to deal with her loss and to know that I touched her life with this book.
1,"Ask yourself:""Do i feel lucky""","A great game,even though you need to a lot of patience,but I guess that's what makes it great,couse even though you thought you've been to a place you can't expect the same things when you get back there.This game can really make you jump with fright,especially when you are really concentrating.Those zombies jumping up from nowhere.Wow.Don't play it when your'e alone,you'll scare yourself.Graphics is absolutely great.Blowing those zombies to bits is also really cool.Sounds are very realistic and sometimes really scary.You'll love this game no matter what.It's like starring in a great action movie(well except your'e a girl if your'e actually a guy,but a girl that can really kick butt and stand her ground).All I can say is.Coooooool."
0,Awful Movie,"The movie was a big let down, the voice talent and animation is a lot lower quality then the original movies, and songs were horrible.Plus the new girl Porcha is a spoiled rich girl who is mean to Carrie and Amy through most of both movies. I had bought it for my nieces but they started to mimic the movie by calling people goobers so we do not let them watch it any more."
0,In all Honesty,"This game has got great graphics, even better than the previous bond - Goldeneye. (I loved Goldeneye that was a great game) But.....the very detailed graphics have SLOWED DOWN the game. Compaired to goldeneye this game runs VERY SLOW. The controls are also different. The game play in this new bond compaired to the older one (goldeneye) is just terrible.If you have to choose between the new one and goldeneye buy goldeneye. If your looking for an awsome second bond for the nintendo 64 your going to have to wait. Unless you like graphics over game control don't buy this game!"
1,One of the best,"This CD is so good words are hard to come by to describe it. Ricky Van Shelton's voice is perfect for Gospel music and the song choice's on this recording are great. I bought this from Amazon with the hope that because Van Shelton was singing it, that it would be good. I was not disappointed. This CD is great."
1,Not Just Another Rap CD,"I bought this CD because of one song-""What Would You Do"". This is definately the BEST song on the album. The message is sad b/c it talks about a mother who has to work as a prostitute to feed her son, but I absolutely love it. The rest of the album is ok, but What Would You Do is the deepest song on here. As well as ""Sista"". I don't like rap music that much but City High is different."
0,Hmmm when is the full saga coming George !!,"It's alaways the same, we,ve been waiting years for this to come out and when it does you think to yourself, shall i buy it..I have decided not to, not because i'm not a fan of Star Wars, it's because i'm fed up with, all the film companies releasing colections only to replace them with another special edition anniversary etc etc edition.I know that Mr Lucas is going to put all 6 films in one super collection and when he does you can be sure thats the one I will buy, so people stand up to these people who keep bringing out different and better versions lets just keep it sensible.P.S Bet the collection is in time for Christmas LOL !!!"
0,"Without Owen Wilson, There Would Be One Star","If you choose to rent and watch this, rent a hammer as well. First, smash the DVD of this to oblivion and then whack yourself on your bean several times for being such a knob. Dumbness, lameness, lousy acting mixed with a lousy plot and marginal purpose to OK computer generated action sequences. Whap yourself again if you ever think of this terrible movie again. The good stuff of this movie would make a total of an amusing four minute YouTube video with cowboy Owen Wilson and the Roman general bickering. That is it. Don't make me break out my own hammer... Move on. Bad, bad, bad movie."
0,Disappointing wix filter,The filter had less pleats(18) compared to my old Fram air filter(30). More pleats means more surface area for filtering the air. The rubber around the edges were loose and didn't form a proper seal.
0,Bad quality USB speakerphone,This is a USB speakerphone of the worst quality I've ever seen. The sound quality is bad. My partner can hardly hear what I said. It is not the loudness but the echo. I will not recommend this speakerphone to anyone.
1,lots o fun,"This Game is lots of fun. I bought it to play with my family over the X-mass holiday. The only down side is that the cards don't say what they do on them, you have to look them up in the book which comes with the game. This makes for slow game play at first. However, there are 2 different versions of this game available, and the collectors edition has printed what the cards do right on the cards, plus the art work on the cards is much nicer. I highly recommend getting the collectors edition, it's worth the extra couple of bucks."
0,funny indeed,"Wrote Joe Nye : ""Alexa led me to the bed in the middle of the enormous room and pulled me down beside her. I kissed her breasts and ran my hand between her thighs. She gripped my shoulders tightly. Unlike the first time I made love to Alexa, when the ecstasy had been eroded by a sense of anxiety and uncertainty, I was sucked into this moment as quickly and completely as if I had placed my feet in quicksand. Memories from years ago blended with intense physical excitement in a driving, pounding torrent of passion.""Ridicule does not kill, but it can definitely lighten up your day!"
0,Are you kidding me?,"This movie was abysmal. I don't understand how anyone could possibly rate it over two stars. The acting was ridiculous, it is amazing that Robert Duvall lent his name to the film. The cinematography was terrible. The plot also seemed thoughtless, although, having not read the book, I cannot attest to its faithfulness. It seemed as though the producers spent the movie's entire budget on payroll, as the props, writing, etc. were all very shabby. Overall, it is hard to even watch the movie all the way through."
1,Healing The Wounded emotions,Good all round book for the doctor or counsellor looking at non pharmacological means to tacklean immense problem in society today.Also some key spiritual truths as emotions are intimatelylinked to the human spirit.
1,The Heart of All Youngs Music,"This has to be the Neil Young album to savour. Known as on of the ""roughest"" of all youngs albums, with that said, this is the best by far of Youngs early recordings. Songs such as L.A., and Last Dance, will leave you loving this rare gem. This is the cornerstone of all Youngs collection, left for you to love over and over again!!!! You aren't a Young fan until you have heard or loved this album."
0,Dumbest game in THE WORLD!!!!!! :-(,"This is the dumbest game ever, no questions asked. I thought Sega would do a better job for a game like this! Let me explain my experience:Well, first of all, I rented this game (good thing too) and I came home excited to play it because I'm really into monsters, and creating and customizing stuff. Well so I played it and I hated it. That's all there is to be said about ""Stupid, stupid, stupid Amazing Island!!!!!"" It's a good thing I only rented it, because I almost wanted to buy it before I knew what it was like. :-( DON'T RENT OR BUY IT! DON'T PLAY IT, PERIOD!"
0,It's going back!,I orderd this lens a few days ago and I am not keeping it. Here is my reviewPros:* Solid build quality* Fast and quiet autofocus* Well controlled Barrel Distortion even at 17mm.Cons:* After testing this lens for 2 hours. 95% of the pictures were comming out dark with some indoor pictures having dark corners even with my flash on. Picture taken at 2pm on a bright sunny day were dark and colors were dull!!!*My other L lens EF 70-200 f 4 (from 4 years ago) takes amazing picture compared to this one.ConclusionI think this is quality assurance issue. We are in bad economical times and Canon is getting cheap.Now I have to spend $20 to send it back...I am thinking that I am much better off walking into a store and paying the extra bucks and test the lens before buying it...or get a used one from 4 to 5 years ago. In otherwords treat any lens produced in the last 2 years like a Sigma lens test it before you buy it
1,Great workout,"ORDER THIS!! I was introduced to Minna after after seeing and doing a brief workout with the Fitness/Exercise On Demand Channel. After doing this routine a few times, I soon ordered the DVD and haven't been disappointed. It is an incredibly wonderful workout for fat burning. The added Bonus 15 minute training for abs really hits the spot (ouch! in a good way). I especially liked the Grace and Balance portion. Minna is concise and uplifting in that she provides a different type of cardio workout. The routine is not boring and very doable. You can start out slower if you need to and work your way up to her speed (which is what I did). I am very happy I ordered this DVD and you will too."
0,Do not buy this,"My first unit lasted about 5 months, and I had it replaced under warranty costing me about $40 or so in shipping costs and about a month's time. The replacement lasted about a year before it just suddently stopped working. The unit is quiet, so I didn't notice that it quit working until I saw the temp was at 81. I wonder how long it was out before I noticed? Customer service has yet to respond to my inquiry - it's been about a week now. Bad product is matched by bad customer service."
1,Nice Iron,"I bought this iron about two years ago. I'm forever leaving water in it, even when it's off. Big mistake as it spits water, as well as the heating element doesn't work properly. Irons aren't made to take this abuse, and now I have to get another. However, I'll buy another just like this as I love the titanium finish on the soleplate. I can't tell you how many times I've used fusible fabric, and it never stuck! Much better than any non-stick surface I've used. Wish I could get the iron repaired, as everything else works fine."
0,Not exactly symmetrical,"I would return this if I could. I thought this would have been a terrific razor considering the reviews. However, after a few months of use and switching blades (again, switching) I have noticed that one side shows more blade than the other...hence one side of the shave is ""closer"". Not sure what to do."
0,Dissapointing.,"The word that I frist heard describing Kelly's new Album was edgey, and if by edgey you mean full of annoying guitar melody's then it is very edgey. The lyrics are fine, but they would have worked so much better if they were put the good music. Like I said the lead guitar is just overwhelming and annoying. Kelly Clarkson is famous because she is an amazing singer, and I don't want to hear her overshadowed with guitar melodies and overproduced background beats."
1,Sugar Artistry!,"Wanted this book for several years--Gave up owning this book, due to being out of print with an extremely high resale price ($99.00 plus). Now that it is more reasonable - so I am now a very proud owner! This is a great addition to my collection of her books. She was my first ""idol""!"
1,Great toddler book,"My 21-month-old son adores this book. The illustrations are bright and cheerful. The story has fun sounds to make, and he learns to count throughout the book. A wonderful toddler book."
0,Product still faulty in 2008,"My husband bought me this tool in 2008 and it has the same fly-apart head construction that other reviewers describe. Mine even broke a window. The tool is so non-functional that I don't see how B&D could have put it on the market. They clearly didn't test it themselves. When it isn't flying apart, it consumes cutting line as if it were spaghetti. I would NOT buy another string trimmer from Black and Decker."
0,salt leaks out of the bottom,I purchased these salt and pepper shakers because they looked nice. They don't hold a lot of salt or pepper and the salt leaks out of the bottom. This was a bad purchase. I would not recommend them to anyone.
0,Poorly made,"I got this doll for my 3 year old grandson, while he was playing with it, the very first day we got it, his leg snapped off. The joint broke completely, and he was not playing rough with it...just carrying it around, by the head no less. He tried to take the mask off and...*SNAP* the leg came off."
0,She's Lost Her Keen Eye,"This is perhaps the fourth book by Ann Tyler that I have read and I realized after completing it, I continue to look for and hope for the bite, the razzle-dazzle keen eye she had for the human condition found in her earlier work.Alas, it isn't in The Amateur Marriage. This book has a cast of completely forgetable and unlikable characters, mundane plotlines and conflict, and no real developmental arc to any of them. If this is her subtle metaphor for life and marriage, well, thanks, but that's not my experience and that's certainly not why I shell out 25 bucks to read fiction! I like real life portrayed presented through the language of a gifted wordsmith--someone who can take ""ordinary"" and hold it up as extaordinary--she's done that before! Life's too short and I'll probably not waste another minute of it wading through another Anne Tyler novel."
0,"Adequate, eventually","This tripod is easy to setup for hands-free shower usage, but the nozzle hangs too low for stand-up showers. In part because I've hacked in a much better shower head for the Zodi hose that hangs even lower, I also had to hack an extension for the upright to get the entire rig to hang just above my head (I'm 5'10; thankfully my shower hut is 7' :). If you need to raise the curved piece, a piece of 3/4"" white PVC tubing slides right over the tubes with enough support for the top piece and the shower head, without throwing off the tripod balance too badly.Also, on first assembly, we found how poorly the curved piece at the top was welded to the supporting upright; it came off in my hands with very little pressure applied (the other reason why the PVC sleeve became necessary; I have no welding facilities, and didn't think solder would be as strong as I needed.)It looks good in principle, but the low height and cheap manufacture work against it in my books."
0,Season two Sucks in Japanese Audio........,"Like I said in my review of the season one box set......DON'T BUY IT, IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!!!Update: Reported by ICv2 in April 2010, Toei is now offering all 200 episodes refurbished of the series for internatioal soliction( I don't know if they included the two specials and the three movies though(please have someone answer that part)). Sorry it came so late."
1,Good Study Bible,"Very good study Bible. McCarthur is very diligent in studying the Bible and all types of resources surrounding it such as history, Greek, Hebrew, other Christian works, secular works, etc. Not a big fan of NASB or NKJV of the Bible, though many prefer them. In some cases the reading is more difficult. For example (NASB then KJV) magi-wise men, dissipation-riot, sordid-filthy, diadems-crowns. Obviously there are examples where the opposite is true also. Another place to look at some NASB changes is hissheep.org. A good, understandable KJV non-study Bible is the Defined King James Bible by Bibles for Today. Hardcovers are reasonably priced. Anyway the McCarthur Bible is a good and informative study Bible."
0,Zzzzzz,I could not get interested and eventually gave up. There are too many good books to read without wAsting time on this.
0,Moon Pool and cave diving,"I bought this book without very high expectations, because it was apparently published originally as a mass-market paperback. But I'd been told it had a hi-tech cave-diving theme, and it did turn out to mention several cave-divers I know. (But the scene is really a flooded mine.) It's not a mystery; you find out whodunit on the first page of the first chapter. I guess it's a suspense thriller. I found it readable, but the author's inclusion of lots of unnecessary facts in an effort to show off his research skills did get a bit tiresome. The author is better at technology than character development."
0,clean up daily :(,"Absolutely disappointingcant pour out of carafe without a total mess on counter top talk about frustrating...I would rather wait a couple minutes longer for brewing than to have half of it on my counter ... never will i own a Bunn again ,,, mistake ..."
1,Excellent,What can I say? Rochelle has yet to disappoint me in the things she's written. I truly enjoyed the Hideway Saga and this after not reading a romance novel in over 20 years.
0,Not high enough,This seems to be well made but I have a 4 month old toy poodle. Weighs 3.2 pounds. She gets over this. Not good for any dog since they don't come too much smaller than mine
1,Nice hat for the price,"This is a nice mid level hat. For the 12 bucks I paid, I certainly am happy with the hat. It seems well made and should last me the entire baseball season (I play on an adult baseball team with the Indians as our mascot). If you are wearing it casually, I'm sure it would last several years."
0,Full of Rah Rah Rah,"Here's all he should have put in this book, ""You can do it"" because that's all I found. Very little in this book was helpful to me, maybe that's because I didn't want to read a book that only talked about how great the author was and how you can do it too. Mind you, he didn't actually tell you how, but he told you he was going to, up until the end of the book."
1,pet water dishes,This is a great product. I've purchased several of these in different sizes. I bought one of the larger ones which was a little too heavy for me to manage so I have multiple smaller ones. They're easy to use and go right into the dishwasher.
0,A little disappointed,"If you need help choosing and interviewing doctors, mid-wives, nannies, etc., there are many pages dedicated to helping you do so. However, I felt this did not apply to me personally. Also, there aren't enough blank spaces to take notes, just a few lines. I was expecting more space to take day-to-day notes. I ended up buying another journal after using this for a week."
1,Love it!,I love this sink and wish I had bought it years earlier. It was so easy to install. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a single bowl sink. I also like how deep it is.
0,What on earth?,"I watched the preview and decided to rent this from iTunes. That was a big mistake... I remember thinking that the preview probably was the best part of the movie, and sure enough... You'd need an army of disbelief to suspend to make this even plausible.This could have been fun, if it had gone campy and not tried to take itself serious... but NO! And don't even get me started on the ending.I just don't know what they were thinking... This disaster movie is a disaster!"
1,Very good product.,My son soesn't like the variable nipple so I tried this one. He takes the bottle very well. Only problem is that it's hard to find at stores. So buy extras when found.
1,Learning to keep Sabbath Holy,A Great read for those looking for the reason why to remember the Sabbath. This book is a classic. The body of the book shares why and how God calls us to a time of rest. Heschel's daughter's introduction shares how sacred this time was for her family growing up and the various ways they celebrated the Sabbath. I purchased the book to read a Jewish perspective on Sabbath from a beloved Jewish scholar and I was not disappointed.
1,Great product for a great price,"Title said it all. I was able to install the Oxygen Sensor in less than 15 minutes and I'm not a mechanic. With the new sensor installed, I was able to reset my check engine light and passed CA smog test without any glitches."
1,Great Device,"The best money I have spent on my house. I put one in my second story laundry room and one next to my air handler, and I sleep much better now. The one in the laundry room has already alerted us to a splashing situation caused by an overfilled washer and I am sure it saved us more time and money than it cost."
0,Description Needs Editing,Instead of 10-inch should be 9 1/2 inch. Should state skillet has humorous oblong shape instead of tired looking circular shape.
1,fair quality for the price,"I found the aluminium frame a bit heavy and the handlebar not very confortable. Moreover I had to adjust brakes and shifts when I got it, and the instructions were not that usefull. Overall I think is a fair quality for the price."
0,Even their own techs couldn't make it work...,"Perhaps the worst computer product I've ever owned. Spent nearly four hours with a D-Link tech, a tech from my ISP and a tech from my satellite provider. None of them could get this thing to connect to my modem despite trying every imaginable configuration.Took it back to the store where I purchased it and traded it for an older and cheaper Linksys Wireles-G router that was up and running in 15 minutes.Normally I like D-Link products, but this one is junk. Avoid this router like the plague."
